Gomoku is a two-player game where the objective is to place five stones in a row. It is a particular example of a larger class of games called (m,n,k)-games, see here. In the most basic setup, Gomoku is played on a 15x15 (reduced) Go board, although play on a full 19x19 board is also common. Players take turns placing a stone of their colour (black or white) on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
